# Email_Spam_Detection
Classifying emails as spam or authentic using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

In this project, I applied natural language processing (NLP) techniques to build models for detecting spam emails using the Enron Public Email Corpus. The dataset consisted of 1,000 spam emails and 1,000 non-spam (ham) emails, focusing solely on the content of the emails. Multiple experiments were conducted using Naïve Bayes classifiers and various NLP techniques, such as bag of words and TF-IDF. The goal was to identify patterns in email text that would help distinguish spam from legitimate emails. The project demonstrated the effectiveness of simple word-based models, especially when filtering common words and incorporating features like email length and average word length.

The results of the experiments showed that NLP models could achieve high accuracy in classifying spam emails, with the potential to reach upwards of 98% accuracy when combining features from multiple experiments. The bag of words approach, in particular, was highly effective, revealing that certain words were strong indicators of spam. However, further tuning of the model parameters and evaluation on larger, more diverse datasets would be necessary to ensure the model’s generalizability beyond this dataset. This project highlights the importance of feature selection and preprocessing in creating robust NLP models for spam detection.
